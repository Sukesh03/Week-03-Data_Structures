## Overview

This week covered how to handle runtime errors gracefully using exceptions and explored core data structures provided by Java’s Collections Framework. You'll gain the ability to build error-resilient and data-driven applications using built-in tools for managing and organizing data effectively.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Exception Handling Basics

- What are exceptions?
- Types of exceptions: Checked vs. Unchecked
- Using `try` and `catch` blocks

### Day 2: Try-Catch-Finally and Nested Blocks

- Handling multiple exceptions using multiple `catch` blocks
- Writing nested `try` blocks
- The purpose and use of the `finally` block

### Day 3: Custom Exceptions

- Creating user-defined exceptions
- Throwing and catching custom exceptions
- Understanding `throw` and `throws` keywords

### Day 4: Introduction to Collections

- Why use collections?
- Overview of the Collection hierarchy
- Using generics in collections

### Day 5: List Interface - ArrayList and LinkedList

- Creating and modifying lists
- Iterating through lists using loops and iterators
- Differences between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` in terms of performance and usage

### Day 6: Set Interface - HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet

- Ensuring uniqueness in sets
- Ordering behavior of different set implementations
- Using sets with custom objects and comparator logic

## Prerequisites

Before starting Week 3, ensure the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed and configured
- An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code is set up
- You are familiar with Java fundamentals and OOP concepts from [Week 1](https://github.com/Sukesh03/Week-01_Core_Programming) and [Week 2]([https://github.com/Sukesh03/Week-02_OOP_Java](https://github.com/Sukesh03/Week-02_Object_Oriented_Programming))

## How to Use This Repository

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific day's topic. These folders include sample Java code, examples, and practice problems that reinforce the concepts discussed:

- Explore each day’s folder to study the code examples
- Run the examples to observe the behavior of exception handling and collection operations
- Modify the code or add new examples to deepen your understanding

This structure is designed to support hands-on learning and reinforce key concepts in exception handling and collections.
